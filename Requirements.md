The project requires the use of Jupyter notebook and Python programming language. The following libraries are necessary for the successful implementation of the project:

1. **requests**: to make HTTP requests in Python <br>
2. **re**: provides a set of tools for working with regular expressions <br>
3. **beautifulsoap**: used for web scraping purposes to pull the data out of HTML and XML files <br>
4. **nltk**: for text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization <br>

You can install these packages using pip. For example:
    pip install requests
    pip install beautifulsoup4
    pip install nltk

Note: some packages such as re and warnings are built-in and do not require installation.

The tutorial have clear documentation on how to install and use these libraries. The code is well-commented and organized using Jupyter notebooks. <br>
