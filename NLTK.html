    <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-center" style="margin-center: 20px;"><b> What is NLTK?</b></p>
    <p class="mb-0 leading-relaxed text-align=justify" style="margin-left: 20px;">NLTK stands for "Natural Language
        Toolkit",
        which is a popular open-source library for natural language processing (NLP) in Python. It provides tools and
        resources for tasks such as tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and machine learning in the context of
        processing human language data.

        With NLTK, developers and researchers can easily implement various NLP techniques in their Python applications.
        NLTK also includes a vast collection of language resources such as corpora, lexicons, and grammars, which can be
        used for language modeling and text analysis.

        NLTK is widely used in academia, research, and industry for a wide range of NLP tasks, including sentiment
        analysis, language translation, named entity recognition, and text classification, among others.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-center" style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>What NLTK is NOT?</b></p>
    <p class="mb-10 leading-relaxed text-align=justify" style="margin-left: 20px;">
        NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is not a complete solution for natural language processing (NLP) on its own.
        While it provides a wide range of tools and resources, it requires knowledge of programming and NLP concepts to
        use effectively. Additionally, it may not be suitable for all NLP tasks or languages, as its algorithms and
        resources may not be optimized for certain languages or tasks. It is also not a machine learning library,
        although it does provide support for training and using machine learning models for NLP tasks. Finally, it is
        not a substitute for understanding the linguistic and cultural context of the text being processed, which is
        often crucial for accurate analysis and interpretation.

    <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-center" style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>Installation</b></p>
    <p class="mb-10 leading-relaxed text-align=justify" style="margin-left: 20px;">The Python Package Index and Setup
        utilities
        make it simple to install NLTK. Type the below mentioned command to install NLTK on your
        computer:
        <pre>
             pip install nltk                      
        </pre>
        After the installation is complete, you can launch a Python shell and import the nltk package to test if it is
        installed correctly:
        <pre>
            python
            >>> import nltk
            >>> nltk.download('punkt')    
        </pre>
        The nltk.download('punkt') command downloads some sample data needed by the NLTK library. You can replace punkt
        with any other dataset you may need for your NLP tasks.
